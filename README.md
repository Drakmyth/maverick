## Instructions

### Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

### Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
